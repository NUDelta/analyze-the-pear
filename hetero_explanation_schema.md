[Self-, Hetero-]Explanation
A participant naturally or spontaneously verbalizes an elaborated explanation of an existing process
Self-Explanation: explaining something for yourself
Hetero-Explanation: explaining something for someone else
Examples
When a person makes explicit something that may be implicit in their code (the person does not necessarily need to have typed that code) or in statement
Scenario of implicit to explicit in code
Verbally steps through a code snippet to explain what is happening
Scenario of implicit to explicit in statement
P1: “We could use a stack”
P2: “What is a stack”
P1: defines stack
When a person writes some pseudocode and walks through it line by line



NOT when both individuals are working together to articulate a concept
NOT a description of what an individual is doing
NOT a description of a plan unless their is supporting reasoning (explanation) provided

A: ohh
B: you can just add it to that
A: add it
B: at the end we can just divide it by scores.
</a>

NOT: "we need to for loop first, cause we need to look at each number" bc this is a description not explaining why

NOT BC OF CONTEXT:
A: um one thing to remember is that we need to return the index numbers, like an array of index numbers

"B: ok, we can have another, have var index and if it does go into if we can say, oh no [we should have two arrays](./planning_schema.md)

A: ya

B: append i and append the nums, does that make sense"

QUESTION:
B: [so we'll have less than target, we'll have another array that says index, and if this condition meets then we add nums at i to less than target and i to index, does that make sense.](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schema.md)
