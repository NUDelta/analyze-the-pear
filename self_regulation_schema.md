Everything here is a direct quote from Ko’s Self Reg

Planning: “Learners reflect on what their next step in the problem solving process should be”
Definition
“Expressing intent to perform some task or description of a task participants is doing”
Contexts
“Did new information reveal a gap in understanding”
“What tasks remain for implementation”
Examples
“I’m going to initialize variables first”
“I’m just copying the code from the example”

Process Monitoring: “Programmers explicitly monitor their progress toward solving a problem“
Definition
“Declaring that a programming sub-goal is complete”
Context
“Is a sub-goal complete”
“Is the code sufficiently tested”
Examples
“So that’s the end of the for-loop”
“So I got the first part. Going on to the second”

Comprehension Monitoring: “Learners should monitor their understanding of computational concepts in problems and solutions”
Definition
“Reflection about the understanding of code or problem prompts
Context
“Am i confused”
“Is my understanding of this failure accurate”
Examples
“I don’t know, end while means…”
“And so actually, I don’t know how this golf scoring works,”

Reflection on Cognition: “Learners should make judgements about the qualities and limitations of their memory and reasoning”
Definition
“Judgements about mental processes, mistakes, assumptions, or biases”
Context
“Am i forgetting something”
“Am i making any assumptions”
Examples
“I was refreshed from earlier about how to do logical operations within while loop.”
“I read the question wrong”

Self-explanation: “Learners should explain to themselves why they have come to a conclusion or decision and then use that rationale to monitor their progress”
Definition
“An account of why a decision was correct”
Context
“This was the right loop condition because it halts at the end of the list”
Example
“So I don’t need LCV because, probably because we don’t have a list”
“The average will be zero at first because we didn’t add anything”
