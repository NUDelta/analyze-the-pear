A: Would we have to use the console log in the...


Arm: Yea, that's actually a great question, if you add console log, in that test output you saw how it turned yellow, the console will actually show up there.


A: Ok


Arm: So you don't have to open the inspector, on your browser


A: Ok


Arm: cool, so as far as the instructions go I know there's a lot so if you're good with questions we can get started. If you go to the firepad, smae place, there should be a new link, you can use that link and get started the same way and go in order with the challenges.


Josh: Wait,


Armaan: oh wait sorry


Josh: no no you're good


Arm: oh actually a really important point, our goal here is to test our system and it's no reflection on you guys by any means. It's a test on our system


Josh: give me one sec, one two three....


Armaan: um and sorry before you get started one more thing, we're gonna go for 40 minutes so we'll stop you whenever time is up


A: Oh, ok


Arm: We're actually gonna go for 35 minutes


A: 35 minutes


A: mumbling the prompt


A: ok


A: so we can just collaborate on this right?


A: [two variables right?](./planning_schema.md)

B: which two do you want?


A: [so we need to count the number of scores that are equal to or higher than 70.](./planning_schema.md) So let's see...


A: Let's do... that look right? ok


A: why can i not su--


B: oh you have to use the card to do the -- array


A: oh mumbles (that's ture), Oh I see


B: so var


A: scores


B: you used the same name as this (pointing to parameter in function -- matched variable
name)


A: oh no we cant (when trying to change name) how do I go back


B: can we go back


B: if we wanted to change a variable name, how would we do that


Arm: so in order to edit a line you would have to write


B: write code?


Arm: right, so if you submitted the action then if you wanted to edit you would have to write code


B: unintelligble


A: see I can't do that cause


B: is it cause you have to have the


A: yea i dont have the card anymore so i cannot edit the named variable


Arm: sorry could you just show me one more time


A: alirght so i wrote scores, without realizing htey were the sam name so when I go to writ code to edit the name of the variable it doesnt let me do that


Josh: yea because it count as a new array


Arm: ok


A: is there a way to fix that? cause I don't have the...


B: should we just restart it


Arm: I think, so ya i didnt realize but you would need another array card


a: restart?


Arm: well, you would just keep playing


A: ok


B: uh how else we can do this


A: lets see um,[we should look through every number in there.](./planning_schema.md) so should we get the for
loop?


B: yea


A: I'm just going to pass it to you


B typing


B: speaking softly, presumably about what he is doing


A: get the size of the...


B: i++, more soft speaking about what he is doing


A: I have the conditions


B: continues speaking softly


A: well, um notice the...


A: reading aloud return the average among the passing scores.


A: [So we need to have another array of all the passing scores, or uh this could be it](./planning_schema.md)


B: i can't like submit the for loop at all right now


A: you cannot? why not? I think you need to click it.


A: Why is it not working...


B: yea


A: here cancel, yea


B: this should be i is less than scores.length right? this is correct right?
06:38


B: we have to think of how to do this without... I'll submit action for this because I have to do the for loop anyway


B: just to check if ... oh unintelligible


A: yea the variable name  *referring to incorrect spelling of var passed in parameter*


B: oh


a: can you change?


B: yea, yesss


A: ok that's good. alright


B: just to check, what our scores would be [lets like print all the elments in scores.](./planning_schema.md) Cause I don't know if scores would be an empty array or this array


A: well we need to get rid of that line, right  *referring to duplicate variable name*
07:21


B: alright, should i get rid of it?


A: [let's get rid of it](./planning_schema.md)


B: so I write that... and


A: [cause we are going to be given the scores in an array form](../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


B: yea

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: I think we can use an if statement inside, ahh we can do it every element of scores and say if--
A: if it is greater, greater than or equal to 70 we put it into a different stack
B: a different array?
A: or add it to some array
</a>

B: you don't have-- how come you have to update, [i can just put another var in the top that is an integer](./planning_schema.md)

<a href=../hetero_explanation_schema.md>
A: ohh
B: you can just add it to that
A: add it
B: at the end we can just divide it by scores.
</a>

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
A: so we need two variables
B: two variables
A: one for
B: one's the counter and one's the editor
</a>

A: ok


B: so I only have one action so [I'll write the var counter](./planning_schema.md), speaks what he types "counter = 0"


B: submit action and it goes to you


B: you can do write code


A: so... speaks as types "var totalsum"


B repeats back to him


A: so then I need to put the if condition right? consume card, conditional, if i scores of i is
greater than or equal to 70, um counter we add to -- no


B: no


A: totalsum


B: equals, scores i


A: yup and then


B: uninteligible


A: oh right, and then, increment by one right?


B: semicolon


A: do i need an else case for this or no, no right, and then


Josh: so you can't actully fill in the body of the if statement in the same move as the write- consume move


A: oh


B: oh i see


Josh: so consume would just be placing down the if statement and then you would just be using the write move to fill in the body


A: ok got it


B: parenthesis, do you have to put parentheses on the if conditional for javascript


Josh: uh you can run the code and check


A: and then now i have to run it right


B: run the...


B: do adding parentheses count as a move


Josh: um yes


B: i think you have to submit the parentheses first


A; here


A: and then write code right


B: now write the other part


A: ok


B: [you can redo this part, the first one](./planning_schema.md)


A: oh cause each line


B: [and I ll do the second one](./planning_schema.md), under breath, plus plus (korean, presumably asking if plus
plus) -


A: i dont know


B: it should be


A: yea, oh they do have ++


B: i already wrote it. Counter = counter + 1 score = totalsum totalsum += else ........

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: another action, I'll write code and then I'll do totalsum divided by counter
A: yea and
B: return totalsum divided by counter
</a>

A: wait why would you put that there, inside the for?


B: oh


B: unintelligible, totalsum divdied by counter is  this good?


A: do you want to do console log to that?


B: with return?


A: instead of return


B: [oh instead of return? I'll do both](./planning_schema.md)


B: Do we have to return or console log it?


Arm: sorry say that again


B: it says to return i think


Josh: you should return your final solution


B: oh ok instead of printing it?


A: and they have an ending bracket all the way at the bottom


B: oh really


A: yea


B: oh, ok, should i run it?


A; let's try


B: ahh


A: oh why we getting Not a Number


B: [its because there arent any passing scores](../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


A: right


B: [so after the for loop we need to have like if, if ocunter =0, if counter = 0 return 0](./planning_schema.md)


A: right


B: do you have another conditional card,


A: if


B: yea, [i have a conditional so i'll write it](./planning_schema.md), so if, this is outside the---


A: counter right?


B: this is right right?


A; and then you pass it to me right?

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: or i'll write the..
A: oh one more
B: return 0, submit action and run it
</a>

A: alright it worked


B: after we do the challenge do we submit right?


Arm: yea so if you feel like you are done you can submit code and go on to the next one


A: ok, so we did, average passing score


B: summing arrays


Arm: no so i would just refresh the original link


Josh: lemme throw you a new link
14:24 START OF NEW CHALLENGE


A reading quietly aloud


A: so given an array of numbers we need to find two numbers that add to a certain


B: ohh


A: ok so I think the [first step should be just ruling out all the numbers that are greater than the target](./planning_schema.md)


B: mhmm


A: assuming that they're all positive


B: ok


A: can we make that assumption


B: ya because we can't, or reads quietly


A: well it just says numbers


B: ya we have to add


A: ya


B; since we have to add lets do it


A: let's assume that case and code first. So rule out anything


B; i don't have a conditional


A: Alright you have a conditional


B: consume card conditional?


A: wait wait, we need to, actually ya write the condition, no we need to look for, [we need to for loop first, cause we need to look at each number](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schemas)


B: for loop for var i =0 i less than


A: same thing with the length


B: is it nums, nums.length was that the write syntax


A: ya


B: i++,the for loop submit action, 

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: consume card conditional, inside right?
A: conditional inside yes
</a>

B: so our first one would be, whats the first one? first one should be if nums ......... [i think you should make another, when you get the separate array and it fits, if nums is greater than target, if nums is less than target we append it to the array, else we just keep looping](./planning_schema.md)


A: can you append to an array


B: it should be unintelligible


A: push


B: push


A: alright so you have the object card so I think that you should


B: object


A: or array


B: i dont have an array card


A: dont have an array card


B: we can discard it to get a new card, but [I'll write the if statement first](./planning_schema.md)


A: ok


B: so if nums at i is less than can it be equal to?


A: um one thing to remember is that we need to return the index numbers, like an array of index numbers


B: ok, we can have another, have var index and if it does go into if we can say, oh no [we should have two arrays](./planning_schema.md)


A: ya


B: append i and append the nums, does that make sense


A: ya ya


B: what did i do, why did i write T, less than target, less than... can the array have a zero in it?


Arm: as an element?


Josh: i dont think we can answer that


Garrett: we can't ansewr that


B: if that, unintelligible
19:20

A: switch, do we need a switch no, for loop ,for loop, do while


B: is this fine should i submit it


A: i mean, how would you proceed afterwards


B; for array, i think we can, i think i can like discard a card, so i can submit


A: i have two for loops


B: is this right though


A: [if nums is less than target ya, thats the conditional we need](../hetero_explanation_schema)


B: submit action. I'll discard object because I don't think we'll need object.


A: um


B: cause we are just using arrays


A: ok


B: yesss


A: we got an array?


B: ya


A; sweet


B: um, consume array, var less than target


20:24

A: [so we are going to add the numbers there less than or equal to target into that number](./planning_schema.md)


B: and, its your turn and i think you should get rid of one of these to get another array card


A: alright, [i need the for loop for sure bc we need to go through that](./planning_schema.md)


A: alright so what are we going to do once we have the array of numbers that are less
than or equal to the target


B: [so we'll have less than target, we'll have another array that says index, and if this condition meets then we add nums at i to less than target and i to index, does that make sense.](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


A: no repeat

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: [so we need to, we have to do two things right, we have to return the index of the nubmers, and we also have to find if the number is equal to ...](../hetero_explanation_schema.md)
A: right
B: [so to check this we are going to add nums i to less than target, *pause* so these are all the numbers less than target, and then, for this we'll have all the nubmers, in this case we'll have 7 and 2 right and our other one, array index , we'll append i into it and that is the the index of these numbers. So first 7 will go in right?](../hetero_explanation_schema.md)
A: yea
B: [so less than target, the first element will be 7 adn the first element of var index would be](../hetero_explanation_schema.md)
</a>

A: [no, um, shit, the index numbers are going to change though. For example if the numbers are 11 15 7 2 we don't care about the 11 and 15 and we are going to put 7 and 2 in there right?](../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


B: mhmm, i think we can find the index, find index of element in array, ya [so you can just do this example so you just need this one array](./planning_schema.md)


A: oh and we'll just compare it to the original array that we got?


B: ya so i think you can just do, write code add it to the


A; ya ya, was it push?


B: let me check, yea .push


A: this right


B: ya think so


A: [so if the number is equal to or less than target we put it into less than target](./planning_schema.md), um what else do we need to do while looking at these numbers? Nothing right?


B: not in there


A: ok so im going to submit action


B: now lets think about how to find all the combinations. Can we use the board?


Arm: yes


23:29

A: lock in the first number


B: got it. The unintelligible speaking while writing


B: we do this, [we can lock in the first number and add it to all of this](./planning_schema.md)


A: ya [compare and see if it works, if not then go to the second one](./planning_schema.md)


B: we can probably just do, for loop


A: for and while maybe?


B: for and while?

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
A: so lock in the first element using for
B: ok, for **speaking while writing on board** var x = 0, like that? thats just locking in the first
element
</a>

A: ok

<a href=./planning_schema.md href=../hetero_explanation_schema.md>
B: then you want to add this to everything else right
A: like, while the sum is not the target, um,
B: while sum is not the target. Or...
</a>

A whispers code that he is thinking thorugh


B: can we do this?


A: how about a for and an if?


B: for and a if?


A: ya


B: like down here


A: like while looking throgh the elements


B: [so for .. x equals i + 1, cause so it fits this then it would start here and go here here and if this becomes one, it'll start here and ell we don't have to add this because we did that already, and i + 1 will be here so we'll add this and this and here it will just add this. Does that makes sense? **A intermittently said right, yes, ya, in agreement](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


26:23


A; what happens at the end condition


B: at end?


A: would it throw and error?


B: end-


A: it would right

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: so we'll just have an if at
A: we don't have the cards for that
B: [so we can just unintelligible, cause itll just do here here and here, so i think length -1](../hetero_explanation_schema.md)
A: oh cause we don't have to account for the-
</a>

B: yea so I'll do this x is less than ....


A: same thing right? length


B: [but i think it should be length -x. right? I mean if its here if it does by length itll go over](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


A: right


B: so if x equals one its here so we want to just do it once and twice, length is 4, 4 -1 is 3
so itll do it 1 and 2 and it doesnt do it inclusively


A: so all of this makes sense to me [we just have to add the i+ increment it](./planning_schema.md)


B: plus plus. And thne

<a href=../hetero_explanation_schema.md>
A: so like [return the sum value if they add up](./planning_schema.md). no we need to return the index values
B: return the index values
A: yea. so right now it's just looking through the different pairs right?
</a>

B: mhmm, so we do, oh i shouldnt use x here i should use a different one, use y, so if y plus or at x equal equal to we can , oh yea, return are we returning a


28:37 returns to seat form whiteboard


A: we need to return the index numbers of the original list


B; we're returning an array right


A: yea so [we need a separate array to store it](./planning_schema.md)


B: [we need to make an another array then to store this](./planning_schema.md), but anyways lets say we have another array called index,


A: mhmm


B: so [i'll do, index.push, y.indexof, i dont think that is the right syntax so we can switch that up, and index.push ... just index.push(x) cause x is the index of this](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


A: yea


B: and after all of this


A: wait wait wait, why is the x not indexof


B: indexof, so this is the index of , this is the indexof this value right
<a href=../hetero_explanation_schema.md>
A: right but this is the new list we are looking at not the original array, the array that we are looking at. Cause we eliminate the numbers that are greater than the target number
B: but the array itself doesnt change,
A: hmm?
B: so this is index 0 1 2 3 right?
A: ya but we are not interested in the those index numbers
</a>

30:06

A: [it needs to be the index number of the original input that we get which includes the numbers that are greater than](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


B: wait did we take out ...


A: that list that we are looking at right now is the less than target array


B: ya

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
A: but if we are going to do it like this than I dont think we need this condition, right?
B: yea, uhhh, let's just do this then,change this name to index and then we just do it this way
</a>

A: ok


B: [then we just do it this way](./planning_schema.md)


A: yea, i i,


B: then


A: I cannot ,i cannot do


B: you can't do that? [I can do it so I can do it later](./planning_schema.md)


A: for


B: ya


A: length


31:10 goes back to whiteboard


B: [so ill change the names](./planning_schema.md), this is, that's nums


A: mhmm


B: this is nums, this is nums


A: um quick thing, we need the, [we need i over there instead of zero](./planning_schema.md)


B: where


A: variable y = nums i


A: y + nums. starting at unintelligible


B: index of unintelligible


B: [after the for loop ends, so after this for loop ends, just do return less than target](./planning_schema.md)


A: yea, no the name,


B: i dont think we have to change


32:45




What did you think
It's cool that we are more confined in our choices, but that also helps us guide in a way. Its confining so it restricts our options, but in a way that helps us move in the righ tdirection


Cause normally we wouldnt right this out we would try it out and get hte output and move on from there. Since we had such a limited amount of cards we would plan everything out perfetly and go on from there
