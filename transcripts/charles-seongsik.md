A: Would we have to use the console log in the...


Arm: Yea, that's actually a great question, if you add console log, in that test output you saw how it turned yellow, the console will actually show up there.


A: Ok


Arm: So you don't have to open the inspector, on your browser


A: Ok


Arm: cool, so as far as the instructions go I know there's a lot so if you're good with questions we can get started. If you go to the firepad, smae place, there should be a new link, you can use that link and get started the same way and go in order with the challenges.


Josh: Wait,


Armaan: oh wait sorry


Josh: no no you're good


Arm: oh actually a really important point, our goal here is to test our system and it's no reflection on you guys by any means. It's a test on our system


Josh: give me one sec, one two three....


Armaan: um and sorry before you get started one more thing, we're gonna go for 40 minutes so we'll stop you whenever time is up


A: Oh, ok


Arm: We're actually gonna go for 35 minutes


A: 35 minutes


A: mumbling the prompt


A: ok


A: so we can just collaborate on this right?


A: [two variables right?](./planning_schema.md)

B: which two do you want?


A: [so we need to count the number of scores that are equal to or higher than 70.](./planning_schema.md) So let's see...


A: Let's do... that look right? ok


A: why can i not su--


B: oh you have to use the card to do the -- array


A: oh mumbles (that's ture), Oh I see


B: so var


A: scores


B: you used the same name as this (pointing to parameter in function -- matched variable
name)


A: oh no we cant (when trying to change name) how do I go back


B: can we go back


B: if we wanted to change a variable name, how would we do that


Arm: so in order to edit a line you would have to write


B: write code?


Arm: right, so if you submitted the action then if you wanted to edit you would have to write code


B: unintelligble


A: see I can't do that cause


B: is it cause you have to have the


A: yea i dont have the card anymore so i cannot edit the named variable


Arm: sorry could you just show me one more time


A: alirght so i wrote scores, without realizing htey were the sam name so when I go to writ code to edit the name of the variable it doesnt let me do that


Josh: yea because it count as a new array


Arm: ok


A: is there a way to fix that? cause I don't have the...


B: should we just restart it


Arm: I think, so ya i didnt realize but you would need another array card


a: restart?


Arm: well, you would just keep playing


A: ok


B: uh how else we can do this


A: lets see um,[we should look through every number in there.](./planning_schema.md) so should we get the for loop?


B: yea


A: I'm just going to pass it to you


B typing


B: speaking softly, presumably about what he is doing


A: get the size of the...


B: i++, more soft speaking about what he is doing


A: I have the conditions


B: continues speaking softly


A: well, um notice the...


A: reading aloud return the average among the passing scores.


A: [So we need to have another array of all the passing scores, or uh this could be it](./planning_schema.md)


B: i can't like submit the for loop at all right now


A: you cannot? why not? I think you need to click it.


A: Why is it not working...


B: yea


A: here cancel, yea


B: this should be i is less than scores.length right? this is correct right?
06:38


B: we have to think of how to do this without... I'll submit action for this because I have to do the for loop anyway


B: just to check if ... oh unintelligible


A: yea the variable name  *referring to incorrect spelling of var passed in parameter*


B: oh


a: can you change?


B: yea, yesss


A: ok that's good. alright


B: just to check, what our scores would be [lets like print all the elments in scores.](./planning_schema.md) Cause I don't know if scores would be an empty array or this array


A: well we need to get rid of that line, right  *referring to duplicate variable name*
07:21


B: alright, should i get rid of it?


A: [let's get rid of it](./planning_schema.md)


B: so I write that... and


A: [cause we are going to be given the scores in an array form](../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


B: yea

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: I think we can use an if statement inside, ahh we can do it every element of scores and say if--
A: if it is greater, greater than or equal to 70 we put it into a different stack
B: a different array?
A: or add it to some array
</a>

B: you don't have-- how come you have to update, [i can just put another var in the top that is an integer](./planning_schema.md)


A: ohh


B: you can just add it to that


A: add it


B: at the end we can just divide it by scores.

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
A: so we need two variables
B: two variables
A: one for
B: one's the counter and one's the editor
</a>

A: ok


B: so I only have one action so [I'll write the var counter](./planning_schema.md), speaks what he types "counter = 0"


B: submit action and it goes to you


B: you can do write code


A: so... speaks as types "var totalsum"


B repeats back to him


A: so then I need to put the if condition right? consume card, conditional, if i scores of i is
greater than or equal to 70, um counter we add to -- no


B: no


A: totalsum


B: equals, scores i


A: yup and then


B: uninteligible


A: oh right, and then, increment by one right?


B: semicolon


A: do i need an else case for this or no, no right, and then


Josh: so you can't actully fill in the body of the if statement in the same move as the write- consume move


A: oh


B: oh i see


Josh: so consume would just be placing down the if statement and then you would just be using the write move to fill in the body


A: ok got it


B: parenthesis, do you have to put parentheses on the if conditional for javascript


Josh: uh you can run the code and check


A: and then now i have to run it right


B: run the...


B: do adding parentheses count as a move


Josh: um yes


B: i think you have to submit the parentheses first


A; here


A: and then write code right


B: now write the other part


A: ok


B: [you can redo this part, the first one](./planning_schema.md)


A: oh cause each line


B: [and I ll do the second one](./planning_schema.md), under breath, plus plus (korean, presumably asking if plus
plus) -


A: i dont know


B: it should be


A: yea, oh they do have ++


B: i already wrote it. Counter = counter + 1 score = totalsum totalsum += else ........

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: another action, I'll write code and then I'll do totalsum divided by counter
A: yea and
B: return totalsum divided by counter
</a>

A: wait why would you put that there, inside the for?


B: oh


B: unintelligible, totalsum divdied by counter is  this good?


A: do you want to do console log to that?


B: with return?


A: instead of return


B: [oh instead of return? I'll do both](./planning_schema.md)


B: Do we have to return or console log it?


Arm: sorry say that again


B: it says to return i think


Josh: you should return your final solution


B: oh ok instead of printing it?


A: and they have an ending bracket all the way at the bottom


B: oh really


A: yea


B: oh, ok, should i run it?


A; let's try

RUNS CODE FOR AVERAGE PASSING SCORE #1

B: ahh


A: oh why we getting Not a Number


B: its because there arent any passing scores


A: right


B: [so after the for loop we need to have like if, if ocunter =0, if counter = 0 return 0](./planning_schema.md)


A: right


B: do you have another conditional card,


A: if


B: yea, [i have a conditional so i'll write it](./planning_schema.md), so if, this is outside the---


A: counter right?


B: this is right right?


A; and then you pass it to me right?

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: or i'll write the..
A: oh one more
B: return 0, submit action and run it
</a>

RUNS CODE FOR AVERAGE PASSING SCORE #2

A: alright it worked


B: after we do the challenge do we submit right?


Arm: yea so if you feel like you are done you can submit code and go on to the next one

SUBMITS CODE FOR AVERAGE PASSING SCORE

A: ok, so we did, average passing score


B: summing arrays


Arm: no so i would just refresh the original link


Josh: lemme throw you a new link
14:24 START OF NEW CHALLENGE


A reading quietly aloud


A: so given an array of numbers we need to find two numbers that add to a certain


B: ohh


A: ok so I think the [first step should be just ruling out all the numbers that are greater than the target](./planning_schema.md)


B: mhmm


A: assuming that they're all positive


B: ok


A: can we make that assumption


B: ya because we can't, or reads quietly


A: well it just says numbers


B: ya we have to add


A: ya


B; since we have to add lets do it


A: let's assume that case and code first. So rule out anything


B; i don't have a conditional


A: Alright you have a conditional


B: consume card conditional?


A: wait wait, we need to, actually ya write the condition, no we need to look for, [we need to for loop first, cause we need to look at each number](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schemas)


B: for loop for var i =0 i less than


A: same thing with the length


B: is it nums, nums.length was that the write syntax


A: ya


B: i++,the for loop submit action, 

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: consume card conditional, inside right?
A: conditional inside yes
</a>

B: so our first one would be, whats the first one? first one should be if nums ......... [i think you should make another, when you get the separate array and it fits, if nums is greater than target, if nums is less than target we append it to the array, else we just keep looping](./planning_schema.md)


A: can you append to an array


B: it should be unintelligible


A: push


B: push


A: alright so you have the object card so I think that you should


B: object


A: or array


B: i dont have an array card


A: dont have an array card


B: we can discard it to get a new card, but [I'll write the if statement first](./planning_schema.md)


A: ok


B: so if nums at i is less than can it be equal to?


A: um one thing to remember is that we need to return the index numbers, like an array of index numbers


B: ok, we can have another, have var index and if it does go into if we can say, oh no [we should have two arrays](./planning_schema.md)


A: ya


B: append i and append the nums, does that make sense


A: ya ya


B: what did i do, why did i write T, less than target, less than... can the array have a zero in it?


Arm: as an element?


Josh: i dont think we can answer that


Garrett: we can't ansewr that


B: if that, unintelligible
19:20

A: switch, do we need a switch no, for loop ,for loop, do while


B: is this fine should i submit it


A: i mean, how would you proceed afterwards


B; for array, i think we can, i think i can like discard a card, so i can submit


A: i have two for loops


B: is this right though


A: if nums is less than target ya, thats the conditional we need


B: submit action. I'll discard object because I don't think we'll need object.


A: um


B: cause we are just using arrays


A: ok


B: yesss


A: we got an array?


B: ya


A; sweet


B: um, consume array, var less than target


20:24

A: [so we are going to add the numbers there less than or equal to target into that number](./planning_schema.md)


B: and, its your turn and i think you should get rid of one of these to get another array card


A: alright, [i need the for loop for sure bc we need to go through that](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


A: alright so what are we going to do once we have the array of numbers that are less
than or equal to the target


B: [so we'll have less than target, we'll have another array that says index, and if this condition meets then we add nums at i to less than target and i to index, does that make sense.](./planning_schema.md)


A: no repeat

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: so we need to, we have to do two things right, we have to return the index of the nubmers, and we also have to find if the number is equal to ...
A: right
B: so to check this we are going to add nums i to less than target, *pause* so these are all the numbers less than target, and then, for this we'll have all the nubmers, in this case we'll have 7 and 2 right and our other one, array index , we'll append i into it and that is the the index of these numbers. So first 7 will go in right
A: yea
B: so less than target, the first element will be 7 adn the first element of var index would be
</a>

A: [no, um, shit, the index numbers are going to change though. For example if the numbers are 11 15 7 2 we don't care about the 11 and 15 and we are going to put 7 and 2 in there right?](../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


B: mhmm, i think we can find the index, find index of element in array, ya [so you can just do this example so you just need this one array](./planning_schema.md)


A: oh and we'll just compare it to the original array that we got?


B: ya so i think you can just do, write code add it to the


A; ya ya, was it push?


B: let me check, yea .push


A: this right


B: ya think so


A: [so if the number is equal to or less than target we put it into less than target](./planning_schema.md), um what else do we need to do while looking at these numbers? Nothing right?


B: not in there


A: ok so im going to submit action


B: now lets think about how to find all the combinations. Can we use the board?


Arm: yes


23:29

A: lock in the first number


B: got it. The unintelligible speaking while writing


B: we do this, [we can lock in the first number and add it to all of this](./planning_schema.md)


A: ya [compare and see if it works, if not then go to the second one](./planning_schema.md)


B: we can probably just do, for loop


A: for and while maybe?


B: for and while?

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
A: so lock in the first element using for
B: ok, for **speaking while writing on board** var x = 0, like that? thats just locking in the first element
</a>

A: ok

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: then you want to add this to everything else right
A: like, while the sum is not the target, um,
B: while sum is not the target. Or...
</a>

A whispers code that he is thinking thorugh


B: can we do this?


A: how about a for and an if?


B: for and a if?


A: ya


B: like down here


A: like while looking throgh the elements


B: [so for .. x equals i + 1, cause so it fits this then it would start here and go here here and if this becomes one, it'll start here and ell we don't have to add this because we did that already, and i + 1 will be here so we'll add this and this and here it will just add this. Does that makes sense? **A intermittently said right, yes, ya, in agreement](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


26:23


A; what happens at the end condition


B: at end?


A: would it throw and error?


B: end-


A: it would right

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
B: so we'll just have an if at
A: we don't have the cards for that
B: [so we can just unintelligible, cause itll just do here here and here, so i think length -1](../hetero_explanation_schema.md)
A: oh cause we don't have to account for the-
</a>

B: yea so I'll do this x is less than ....


A: same thing right? length


B: [but i think it should be length -x. right? I mean if its here if it does by length itll go over](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


A: right


B: [so if x equals one its here so we want to just do it once and twice, length is 4, 4 -1 is 3
so itll do it 1 and 2 and it doesnt do it inclusively](../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


A: so all of this makes sense to me [we just have to add the i+ increment it](./planning_schema.md)


B: plus plus. And then

<a href=../hetero_explanation_schema.md>
A: so like [return the sum value if they add up](./planning_schema.md). no we need to return the index values
B: return the index values
A: yea. so right now it's just looking through the different pairs right?
</a>

B: mhmm, so we do, oh i shouldnt use x here i should use a different one, use y, so if y plus or at x equal equal to we can , oh yea, return are we returning a


28:37 returns to seat form whiteboard


A: we need to return the index numbers of the original list


B; we're returning an array right


A: yea so [we need a separate array to store it](./planning_schema.md)


B: [we need to make an another array then to store this](./planning_schema.md), but anyways lets say we have another array called index,


A: mhmm


B: so [i'll do, index.push, y.indexof, i dont think that is the right syntax so we can switch that up, and index.push ... just index.push(x) cause x is the index of this](./planning_schema.md, ../hetero_explanation_schema.md)


A: yea


B: and after all of this


A: wait wait wait, why is the x not indexof


B: indexof, so this is the index of , this is the indexof this value right

<a href=../hetero_explanation_schema.md>
A: right but this is the new list we are looking at not the original array, the array that we are looking at. Cause we eliminate the numbers that are greater than the target number
B: but the array itself doesnt change,
A: hmm?
B: so this is index 0 1 2 3 right?
A: ya but we are not interested in the those index numbers
</a>

30:06

A: it needs to be the index number of the original input that we get which includes the numbers that are greater than](./planning_schema.md)


B: wait did we take out ...


A: that list that we are looking at right now is the less than target array


B: ya

<a href=./planning_schema.md>
A: but if we are going to do it like this than I dont think we need this condition, right?
B: yea, uhhh, let's just do this then,change this name to index and then we just do it this way
</a>

A: ok


B: [then we just do it this way](./planning_schema.md)


A: yea, i i,


B: then


A: I cannot ,i cannot do


B: you can't do that? [I can do it so I can do it later](./planning_schema.md)


A: for


B: ya


A: length


31:10 goes back to whiteboard


B: [so ill change the names](./planning_schema.md), this is, that's nums


A: mhmm


B: this is nums, this is nums


A: um quick thing, we need the, [we need i over there instead of zero](./planning_schema.md)


B: where


A: variable y = nums i


A: y + nums. starting at unintelligible


B: index of unintelligible


B: [after the for loop ends, so after this for loop ends, just do return less than target](./planning_schema.md)


A: yea, no the name,


B: i dont think we have to change


32:45

a: i just wanted to ask first, do you guys know each other?
1: yes 
a: have you guys worked together before
2: not really
1: no
g: so what'd you think of the overall experience?
2: well it's cool that we are, i don't know, that we're confined in our choices, but that also helps us guide us in a way, like it's confining, so it restricts our options, but in a way that just helps us move in the right direction
1: because normally, we wouldn't like write this out, we would just like try it out, and we'd get the output and see what's wrong and change it, go on from there. but since we have such like a limited amount of cards we have to think everything out perfectly before and start coding.
g: were you keeping track of the amount of cards you had, in general?
1: more than the amount of cards, i was keeping track of what cards i had left. so for example i had one for loop and he had two, so we knew we had to finish everything in less than, at max three for loops. none of us had an array, and after i discarded one i had one array, but we couldn't risk using two or more arrays because even if we discarded more cards, we didn't know if we would get the right card. and looking at our cards, we obviously wouldn't use a hash table, we wouldn't use switch, so we had to be smart about which cards to discard. 
g: did you guys know how many cards you had left in the stack before you submitted the code?
2: i had three, think
g: not in your hand, but in the stack. do you know how many cards were in the stack?
2: over here?
g: yeah, at the end of the 
2: i think there were like three or something like that
g: okay. so can you just walk us through, from the beginning of the first problem, and just talk to us about what you guys did and your thoughts on each of the parts, just from the first problem up to now
2: so it was about first eliminating the numbers that were less than seventy, and then getting the average of the numbers that were left. so how did we do that? so basically we used a for loop to look at each element, and then made a sum variable to keep on adding the numbers that were left behind, or that were
1: greater than seventy
2: greater than seventy, in that case, and had a different variable, counter, to track how many numbers we were adding so we could easily get the average afterwards. 
g: and did you come up with that right away? or how did you get to that point?
1: so we were talking to each other about what to do, but i feel like it would have been better if we used something like a writing thing earlier on, because we were talking to each other, but i feel like we were getting a bit confused in the beginning, because we were just talking and it's hard to keep track of what I'm saying. so i think it would have been better if we had wrote something like there. also if we had like a separate window that has like a testing window, we could probably of use instead of or as the whiteboard. like a separate window where we don't have to use the cards just to test, so we could like test it there and we could write down pseudocode like that, and like that's what we want to do so let's add this code into this window or something like that. like if we could do that from the beginning, i feel like it would have been much better.
g: did you guys get into any conflicts? and if so how did you resolve them?
1: i don't think we got into any conflicts
2: well working in a pair communicating really, it's just a useful way of pointing out the small errors that we make. it's really useful. the other thing that i really liked about this is that it forces you to slow down and really think about your step before you take it
g: and why do you think that's useful?
2: as novice programmers, it's just better to get the big picture in before stepping up. because we used dr racket for EECS 111, which is the first programming course we take here, and with that, it's really easy to just run the code every time you write a line. and although i found that helpful, because I'm not skilled to be able to think about this big picture, at the same time i don't think it's helping those students develop the skills of creating a big program. but this really does because you have to first have the picture, like know what you're going to do in each step, and then you'll have most success once you know what you're going to do, and then use the cards. because you only have the limited options. and then end turns
1: and so once you have like the big picture set out, i feel like it's easier to debug. because you would just back to your like pseudocode, your logic code and be like, what's wrong from there, and you could just go down line by line and notice oh, it's probably this line that's causing the error, so let's just try changing that instead of like writing like a [unintelligible] code that we don't really understand. 
g: so you're talking about how you usually code and testing each line, where do you think you learned that strategy and why do you still use it, out of curiosity?
2: well, the thing about coding is that when you mess up in one part, everything else is just, is done. so i just wanted to avoid that entirely, just so that I'm confident that whatever i have so far is gonna give me the result that I'm expecting. so that's what i use, usually. this, well my way of coding makes me test like different methods as i go, and then this is a completely different way of approaching the problem, which is something that i enjoyed actually. it's definitely, it takes time to get used to and plan out your strategy
g: on a bit of a different note, it took a while to learn. we're still trying to figure out the best way to teach this system, because it is pretty different. what were the parts that you felt worked for you while learning how to use cards, how to submit lines, etc. when did you feel like you got it and what helped you learn how to use this system in general?
1: for me, it was in this problem because first neither of us had the array card and we were like okay how do we approach this, how do we get the array card. and that's when we noticed like we had to be smart about which cards to discard to pick which cards we used. 
g: what about the video, vs. doing the example, vs. like just going right into it? like at what point did you think you understood the game?
1: it was the example for me. because i didn't really understand the [unintelligible]
g: would there be anything that you would change about this?
2: what sort of level of programming students are you thinking about/
a: so we're not actually testing your skill level, we're testing at how the system interacts. but we're looking at people who have taken several programming classes but not like ten or eight. so like earlier on in the college programming process
[some talking from armaan and garrett]...
2: yeah, the syntax really just helps
