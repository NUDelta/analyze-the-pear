Planning


Andy Ko Definitions (first used by Andy Ko, second cited from external paper):
1. “Expressing intent to perform some task, or description of a task participants is doing[a]”
2. “Learners should reflect on what their next step in a problem solving process should be” 


Definition:
* Expressing intent to perform some task
   * Not necessarily have to make progress
   * Description of concrete task
   * Often uses imperative language
      * “We need to …(concrete task)”






Example 1:
P1: “two variables right?”
P2: “which two do you want?”
P1: “so we need to count the number of scores that are equal to or higher than 70. So let's see…”
* Degree of planning
   * 2 steps forward
* Is planning?
   * Yes


Example 2:
s: [reading the problem aloud to herself] okay. so we can like, iterate through the list and find which ones are passing scores.


s: and then, lets see, for each loop...
y: so it'd be if var score is greater than 
s: greater than or equal to seventy. should we like add it to a new list?


y: so if scores greater... push, otherwise
s: just like do nothing i guess
y: yeah, do nothing


s: okay so then after the for loop completes we'll have all the scores in our list
y: and then we just need to get out of the for loop and then return…
s: like the average
y: oh, okay. do we need to go through the new?
s: yeah, add them up and then divide by the number. you can make like a sum variable or something


s: we'll have to iterate over the array first
y: yeah, so iterate over this one, and then compare
...
s: okay, so then then you'll do another for loop. and then, close bracket
y: oh yeah, i need a bracket
s: and then like compare array one i 
y: this should be if array one is less than array two j 
s: then we'll like add it, well we can make a new array. then push array i, or solutions dot push


s: do we have edge cases? like what if.. solutions will be empty if there's like nothing[b]


Example 3:
P1: “we should look through every number in there[c]. so should we get the for 
loop?”






Example 4:
P1: “So we need to have another array of all the passing scores, or uh this could be it”


Example 5:
P2: just to check, what our scores would be lets like print all the elments in scores. Cause I[d] 
don't know if scores would be an empty array or this array


E6
P1: “i can just put another var in the top that is an integer”[e]


E7
A: let's get rid of it 


B: so I write that... and 


A: cause we are going to be given the scores in an array form


B: yea


B: I think we can use an if statement inside, ahh we can do it every element of scores and say if--


A: if it is greater, greater than or equal to 70 we put it into a different stack


B: a different array?


A: or add it to some array[f]


E8
B: we have to think of how to do this without...[g]
[a]self explanation
[b]comprehension monitoring, this is an adapt solution task
[c]refers to array
[d]this looks like comprehension or process monitoring
[e]context makes this planning
[f]this is clarifications and is still part of the earlier planning statement
