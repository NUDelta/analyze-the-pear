[Self-, Hetero-]Explanation
A participant naturally or spontaneously verbalizes an elaborated explanation of an existing process
Self-Explanation: explaining something for yourself
Hetero-Explanation: explaining something for someone else

Examples

When a person makes explicit something that may be implicit in their code (the person does not necessarily need to have typed that code) or in statement
Scenario of implicit to explicit in code
Verbally steps through a code snippet to explain what is happening
Scenario of implicit to explicit in statement
P1: “We could use a stack”
P2: “What is a stack”
P1: defines stack
When a person writes some pseudocode and walks through it line by line

Internalization
A person justifies an action to an active participant whose understanding is within the zone of proximal development
Examples
When a person reframes their approach in response to an active participant proposing an alternative approach
Peter: "No, no, our string has been split up and inputted to an array now, so in this array it'll have like each element" (peter-yixi, 0:24:54)
When a person elaborates on their approach to a problem
Moriah justifies/verbalizes what she is doing -- "um if its greater than ... then its this then this or that then that" (using hand motions to express)  (carlos-moriah, 0:6:12)

Alternate Proposal
A person recommends a new approach that is different from the current approach
Examples
Yixi: "What about using something like this?" (peter-yixi, 0:22:54)
Yixi: "I think the for loop should be inside the previous one" (peter-yixi 24:50)
This is in a context when the participants are debugging and looking for sources of the problem
Does Not Include
Moriah: 'Do you want to move on to a different one?' (carlos-moriah, 0:13:12)
Conflict or disagreement
A person offers a different opinion or approach to what another participant believes which leads to a discussion to decide on a way forward
Examples
Yixi: "No, it should go from 0 to i" (peter-yixi 0:20:30)
Scenario
Yixi explains why Peter's method doesn't work (peter-yixi 0:15:51)
Peter explains why he thought his incorrect solution would work (peter-yixi 0:16:17)

Shared Cognitive Load
When a person tells the other participant what should be typed and the other participant follows the orders
Examples
Peter corrects Yixi's syntax errors as he types Peter's solution and tells him what to type (0:28:56)

Mutual Regulation
A person identifies errors in the code or aspects of the code that are missing to the active participant
Examples
Yixi: "Parentheses didn't match" (peter-yixi 0:30:17)
Moriah: 'we need to check for duplicates' (carlos-moriah 0:19:30)

Social Grounding
A person checks another participants understanding of what was just said by verbal or visual cues and acts to reframe communication in the case when the other participant is perceived to not understand
Examples
Scenario
Moriah: on switch - 'um here, use this' pointing to computer (carlos-moriah 0:27:09)
Moriah: specifies after Carlos doesn't show immediate understanding (carlos-moriah 0:27:13)
Does Not Include
An expression of confusion or asking for clarification - the reply to the confusion is often social grounding if in attempt to repair the confusion
